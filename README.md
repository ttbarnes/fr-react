## Icons

The icons were originally built with [fontcustom](https://github.com/FontCustom/fontcustom). Fontcustom has since been abandoned.

We should just use SVGs for icons.

Currently, SVG icons are only used in The SocialLinks component. This component has a mix of fontcustom icons and SVG icons.
